#### Problem Statement:

The current issue with finding a city to live in is accounting for all of the differences of each city.  There are many sources for information; however, they are spread out across the web and not easily agglomerated by users.

----
#### Project Objectives and Features:

 - A web based application that aids people looking to move to a new city in finding one that fits all of their preferences.  
 - Create a large list of preference filters for on databases of city information. Users pick their preferences to be matched with cities that best fit them. 
 - Let the user choose which aspects of a city they want to be factored into their preferences. 
 - Compare cities' data on diversity, job opportunities, cost of living, social scene, school systems, crime rate, real estate market, types of businesses (corporate vs family owned), walkability, parks, restaurants, health and wellness resources, and more.
 - Users can create a list of favorite cites to help them narrow down their choices.
 - Viewing pictures and maps of cities and common attractions, data heat maps that correlate to preference lists

We plan to either utilize the ASP.NET Framework along with C# or React with NodeJS to generate this web application.
